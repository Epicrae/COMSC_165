File Encryption is the science of writing the contents of a file in a secret code. Your encryption program should work like a filter, reading the contents of one file, modifying the data into a code, and then writing the coded contents out to a second file. The second file will be a version of the first file, but written in a secret code. Your program should be able to decrypt the encrypted file. Your program should output the decrypted contents on a separate file and also on the console.
